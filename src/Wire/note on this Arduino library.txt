This version of Wire is the one currently in the standard Arduino framework. I
copied it here because the MightyCore version (the one PlatformIO would use if
this one wasn't here) doesn't seem to work: testing it with the I2C scanner by
Nick Gammon always returned a list of all possible addresses, on both devices.
